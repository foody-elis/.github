## About Us

We are **Giacomo, Matteo and Daniele**, three Computer Engineering students at the **Politecnico di Milano**, while
simultaneously studying at **ELIS** in Rome.

Foody was developed as part of our **Software Engineering course**, serving as both our **final project for the course**
and our **bachelor’s thesis**. Through this project, we aimed to design and implement a **scalable, efficient, and
user-friendly solution** that enhances interactions between customers and restaurants.

This experience allowed us to apply and deepen our knowledge in **software architecture, cloud computing, and full-stack
development**, while also strengthening our ability to tackle real-world challenges through teamwork and innovation.
